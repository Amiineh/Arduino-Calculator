# Arduino-Calculator

This was a project for Computer Structure and Languages course.

In this project we used an Arduino board to create a calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations, also calculation of Logarithm, Power, GCD and LCM of two opperands.
The hardship of this project was having to code operations in AVR assembely.
