# Arduino-Calculator

This was a project for Computer Structure and Languages course.

In this project we used an Arduino board to create a calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations, also calculation of Logarithm, Power, GCD and LCM of two opperands. <br />
The hardship of this project was having to code operations in AVR assembely.

## Input Format
Enter your first operand, then type '+' for addition, '-' for subtaction, '*' for multiplication, '/' for division, 'Log' or 'log' for logarithm, '^' for power, 'GCD' or 'gcd' for GCD and 'LCM' or 'lcm' for LCM operation.
Then enter your second operand.

Please note that in order to run this code you must have the Arduino IDE and board.
